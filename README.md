# Library API

An api to manage books and their authors.

## Getting Started

This section is intended for software developers.  If you have rights to the repo, simply clone the repo.  If you do not have rights to the repo, you may fork the repo and clone your fork.  

```
$ git clone <clone url>
$ cd libary-api
$ npm install
```

### Environment Variables

You'll need to create a local **.env** file to store your application's secret.  Follow these steps to generate and store the secrets.

0. Create a `COUCH_URL` environment variable:  Using Cloudant for example or a local instance of CouchDB, create an API key for the database.  Store the key and password within your **.env** file.  Use the key and password to create an environment variable named `COUCH_URL` using this pattern `COUCH_URL=https://<key>:<password>@<your base url>/`.

  **Example**

  ```
  COUCH_URL=https://sdfrtrerdfsxdnorth:187254aff7762f28afxu92d137c1899c14f7c999@jeffjohnson.cloudant.com/
  ```

0.  Create a `PORT` environment variable used by the client application to connect and communicate with your api.

  **Example**

  ```
  PORT=4000
  ```

0. Create a `COUCH_DATABASE` environment variable.  The name of the database.

  **Example**

  ```
  COUCH_DATABASE=library
  ```
